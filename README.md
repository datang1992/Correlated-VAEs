# Correlate-Variational-Auto-Encoders
Code for my ICML 2019 paper [Correlated Variational Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05335)

The files cvae_ind.py and cvae_corr.py contain the code for CVAEs on general graphs (Section 4.2.3) and the file process_tree_data.py contains the code for constructing the synthetic dataset for the spectral clustering experiment (Section 4.2.2).
